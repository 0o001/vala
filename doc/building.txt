Step one:
--------

Install packages like a C compiler, glib-2.0, flex and bison
TODO: complete this list

Step two:
---------

Grab yourself a vala to c compiled release of vala. Vala is self-hosting so it
needs another vala compiler to compile itself. Since vala compiles to C code,
you can use a tarball release of vala to compile the generated C code of such
a release into a working Vala compiler, that will compile the Vala compiler
which you might have checked out from the repository

http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Release

Step three:
-----------

Compiling the release which you just grabbed:

tar jxvf vala-x.y.x.tar.bz2
cd vala-x.y.z
./configure --prefix=/opt/vala-release
make && sudo make install

Step four:
----------

Compiling the newest Vala from the repository:

svn co svn co svn+ssh://[user]@svn.gnome.org/svn/vala/trunk vala
cd vala
export VALAC=/opt/vala-release/bin/vala
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/vala
make && sudo make install

Maybe you want to compile the new Vala with itself. Then you simply go over
it again:

make distclean
export VALAC=/opt/vala/bin/vala
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/vala
make && sudo make install
